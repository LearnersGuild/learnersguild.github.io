    <h3>A guild is an old idea, set to be the future of learning.</h3>
    <p>In the distant past, if you wanted to learn a trade, you'd join a guild. 
    It wasn't theoretical, it was experential.  Young apprentices would 
    work under proved masters, each generation investing in and giving back to the one that followed. 
    Guilds not only kept their crafts alive, they formed a society of mutual help and companionship.</p>

  <div id="q1b" class="collapse">
    <p>Today's guilds are learning communities entirely different from typical schools. 
      If you want to take on all the financial risk and go it alone, you go to a college or a bootcamp. 
      If you want to be part of a community that loves its craft and those who practice it, 
      if you want to be lifted by others, and to lift others with you, you join a guild.</p>
