              We have a simple proposition: if you don’t get a high-paying job, we don’t get paid. Period. Bring your dedication and passion, and we will invest in you by co-signing for your $28k tuition. And, If you can’t imagine taking 10 months off of work, we offer an optional $1,500 monthly living allowance to bridge the gap. (We understand. It’s hard to focus on learning if you’re also struggling to cover the bills.) After the program, If you graduate and don’t earn at least a geographically-appropriate salary, you owe us nothing.

            Learners Guild is a supportive, collective, environment that is designed around cognitive apprenticeship. We help people do whatever it takes to become ready for a career in web development. This includes learning at least one formal programming language (JavaScript), and a host of other tools and technologies.

          <p class="lead">
            With the help of our expert learning facilitators you will learn not only how to be a great junior engineer but, more importantly, how to be a great learner. We believe a successful career is defined by an open mindset, well-honed collaboration skills, social and emotional intelligence, and an ability to adapt and learn. We know that technologies will keep advancing and changing, so learning how to learn is the most valuable skill for software engineers (and also for life).
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            We stagger our sessions so you learn new skills from others who are a few months ahead, and you master your technique by mentoring those just a few months behind.  In this type of collaborative environment, you will not only build world-class learning aptitude and skills, but also make new friends for life.
