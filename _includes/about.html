        <p class="lead">
        We invest in people as they transform into empathetic engineers with rigorous socio-technical training.

          Software engineers are in high demand, in fact there are thousands of unfilled jobs right now and the gap between open positions and qualified applicants is projected to keep growing. We help those with unrealized potential unlock their talents and transform their lives so they can compete in today’s economy and earn a dignified livelihood.

            Our program is designed to be accessible to all.

          <p class="lead">
            We value a diverse and inclusive environment. We especially encourage historically underrepresented groups in software engineering - people of color, women, LGBTQ people, and persons with disabilities, and veterans-to consider joining us. We think brains work the same no matter where you’re from or how you identify.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            If you’re a driven learner seeking a career in software engineering, we want you.

              We have a simple proposition: if you don’t get a high-paying job, we don’t get paid. Period.

            <p class="lead">
              Bring your dedication and passion, and we will invest in you by co-signing for your $28k tuition. And, If you can’t imagine taking 10 months off of work, we offer an optional $2,000 monthly living allowance to bridge the gap. (We understand. It’s hard to focus on learning if you’re also struggling to cover the bills.)

            Learners Guild is a supportive, collective environment. You learn the craft of software engineering during 10 months of cognitive apprenticeship alongside other motivated learners. Software development doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens with other people, which means knowing how to navigate social dynamics is just as important as knowing how to code.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            With the help of our expert learning facilitators you will learn not only how to be a great junior engineer but, more importantly, how to be a great learner.  We know that technologies will keep advancing and changing, so learning how to learn is the most valuable skill for software engineers (and also for life).

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col_half col_last">
          <p class="lead">
            We stagger our sessions so you learn new skills from others who are a few months ahead, and you master your technique by mentoring those just a few months behind.  In this type of collaborative environment, you will not only build world-class learning aptitude and skills, but also make new friends for life.
