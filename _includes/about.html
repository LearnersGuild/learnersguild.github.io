          Software engineers are in high demand, in fact there are thousands of unfilled jobs right now and the gap between open positions and qualified applicants is projected to keep growing. We help those with unrealized potential unlock their talents and transform their lives so they can compete in today’s economy and earn a dignified livelihood.

            We value a diverse and inclusive environment. We especially encourage historically underrepresented groups in software engineering - people of color, women, LGBTQ people, and persons with disabilities, and veterans-to consider joining us. We think brains work the same no matter where you’re from or how you identify.

              Bring your dedication and passion, and we will invest in you by co-signing for your $28k tuition. And, If you can’t imagine taking 10 months off of work, we offer an optional $2,000 monthly living allowance to bridge the gap. (We understand. It’s hard to focus on learning if you’re also struggling to cover the bills.)

              We are particularly looking for candidates from populations that are underrepresented in the tech industry.  So, Black, Latino, LGBT, women, and persons with disabilities, we’ve designed our program with you in mind. And yes, white and asian guys, we want you too but we’re betting that there is more unlocked talent in those populations that are currently under-represented.  We think brains work the same no matter where you’re from or how you identify.  So, If you’re a driven learner of any background seeking to build full-stack developer skills, we want you.

        <div class="col_half">
          <p class="lead">
            We have designed a supportive, collective environment, where you will learn the craft of software engineering through 10 months of collaborative apprenticeship. With the help of our expert learning facilitators you will learn not only how to code but more importantly how to problem solve and keep learning.  One thing we do know is that technologies will keep advancing so learning how to learn is one of the most valuable skill for software engineers.

            We stagger our incoming classes so you get introduced to new skills from people like yourself who are just a few months ahead of you, and you get to master your technique by learning with those just a few months behind you.  By creating this type of collaborative environment we think you will not only build world class learning aptitude and skills but also new friends for life.

            Software development doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens with other people, which means knowing how to navigate social dynamics is just as important as knowing how to code.

            With the help of our expert learning facilitators you will learn not only how to be a great junior engineer but, more importantly, how to be a great learner and keep learning.  Technology keeps changing, so learning how to learn is one of the most valuable skill for software engineers (and also for life).
