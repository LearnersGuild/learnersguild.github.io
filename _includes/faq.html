                    <em>No.</em> The top-down (teacher-student) approach embraced by most educational systems is out-dated, slow, and inefficient at best. Historically, bootcamps have a short-term vision aimed at helping students enter an industry.

                    Learners Guild, however, has a long-range vision that goes far beyond simply making the leap into software engineering. We want you to be set up for a rapidly advancing, extended career. Our program is designed around a cognitive apprenticeship method of learning-- one that has been vetted by scientists and learning researchers --that has shown itself to be a truly powerful means of both knowledge acquisition and skill development.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Because we use a “mutual exploration” (learners-only) model, and we believe in the effectiveness of this approach, we invest in our learners. It’s part of the collaborative spirit of exploring. If you don’t get paid well after graduating, you don’t owe us. We share the risk with you.

                    Yes. People who have attended schools for many years--- most of us ---assume that teaching is necessary for learning to occur. This is a fallacy. Learning and teaching are different, and we focus on learning. While we certainly have people with in-depth experience, senior level engineers, skilled facilitators, and so on, we don’t have teachers. A well designed learning environment causes a rapid transfer of knowledge from peers. As you learn, you will share what you know. This is a kind of “mutual exploration” of the knowledge. Trying to explain what you know challenges you to deepen your own understanding, even as you assist someone else with theirs.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Because technology changes so quickly, knowing information isn’t enough. It doesn’t take long for today’s right answers to become obsolete. To prepare you, our learning facilitators focus on improving your problem-solving skills. Essentially, you learn how to learn. This way, you’re equipped with the skills that make life-long learning attainable, something that’s critical to becoming a good developer.

                    Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. There’s a big difference. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you must be coerced to learn. We’re not here to coerce. We only accept applicants who have a drive to learn. As learners, we don’t focus on grades. Instead, we focus on improving our understanding and skills. Essentially: We believe that ultimately, reality will be the assessor.

                    Good questions. The cost of attending Learners Guild is $28,000; however, there are no upfront costs. If a learner takes the maximum of the living allowance, that increases their cost of participation by an additional $20,000, bringing the total to $48,000. Once a learner has transitioned out into the workforce with earnings over $60,000, they will be obligated to initiate the repayment of their tuition and living allowance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Typical starting salaries are $85k-$95k a year. Learners have the option of paying back the loan in installments over a five year period, with an average payment of $500 a month for tuition and an additional $300 if the maximum amount of monthly living allowance are used. Learners Guild only makes money by receiving the cost of tuition. We put the stipend back in a pool for other learners to use.

                    It’s in our best interest to see you thrive. We’re very careful to choose applicants who are committed to the process, and if you’re committed to learning, we’re determined to give you all the support you need to finish. In fact, that’s one reason we allow you to take extra time if necessary. That all said, if you opt out, you will still owe the full tuition, and any stipends you’ve received. (On a case-by-case basis, we are willing to pause the program for those who face extenuating circumstances.)

                    There are a few mandatory requirements to participate in the Learners Guild learning collective. They are an ability to participate full-time, a proficiency with the English language, a minimum age of 21 and previous employment history.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Beyond a common desire to become a premium software engineer in a mutually supportive environment ... perhaps first and foremost, all of our learners share a drive to learn and grow. Not just intellectually, but socially and emotionally as well. We expect a minimum level of personal development and maturity.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    We look for a baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring software engineering for the first time. We are a learning collective that best works for advanced beginners.

                    You should consider yourself fit for Learners Guild if you understand and can demonstrate the following:
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Algorithmic notions of control flow </li>

                    </ul>
                    If you are familiar with programming and have a crude understanding of it, then you would have used many of these concepts. If you have at least 50 to 100 hours of programming and web development experience under your belt, you will find Learners Guild an appropriate learning collective that will take your skills to another level.

                    Finally, we are excited about you if you have grit, if you are tenacious and understand that deliberate practice and sustained effort is what puts you on the path to success. We don’t care about your SAT scores, or whether or not you finished high-school, what we are interested in is your ability to learn and excitement about the craft of software engineering.

                    No. We will provide you with your own Mac laptop. If after a month of being at Learners Guild you decide we are not the right place for you, you can keep the laptop as our parting gift.

                    No. Our approach is strictly results oriented. There’s a lot of people with degrees, but no job to match it. It’s a common mistake to confuse a symbol for learning with the actual learning, itself. Learners Guild turns that around: if you don’t end up in a high-paying job, we don’t get paid. Our focus is on getting you ready for the workforce by helping you develop your skills which is demonstrated by your ability to create a portfolio of work.
