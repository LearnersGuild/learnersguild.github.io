      <p class="lead">To be ready for the program, you'll need to gain some basic proficiency in two key skills: <strong>computational thinking</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>.</p>
      <p class="lead">Use the exercises below to help you determine if you are ready and to discover resources that can help you prepare.</p>
      <p class="lead">Once you've finished, you will know if you're ready to submit your <a href ="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/learners-guild-application" target="_blank">application to Learners Guild</a>.</p>
      <p class="lead">If you are not quite ready, we've listed some freely  available resources that you can use to learn. We also recommend seeking out help from other people; software development is a team sport, after all. One place to start is to search for "beginner programmer" or "web development" Meetups in your area.</p>
