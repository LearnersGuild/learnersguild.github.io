        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <p>
          As you can tell, we’re doing things a bit differently. So you’re probably going to have some questions. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, just let us know.

            </div>
            <div class="togglec">

              <p>
                No. We think learning collectives represent a new way for people to learn. The top-down (teacher commands students) approach embraced by most education institutions is out-dated, slow, and inefficient at best. Our program is designed around a cognitive apprenticeship method of learning—one that has been vetted by scientists and learning researchers—that is a truly powerful means of both knowledge acquisition and skill development.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also know quite a bit about bootcamps, in fact our team were pioneers of that industry. But we weren’t satisfied with the results. While bootcamps do a decent job at helping students enter the software industry, they don’t do enough to set people up for rapidly advancing careers and longer term success.

            </div>
            <div class="togglec">

              <p>
                Yes. People who have attended schools for many years&mdash;most of us&mdash;assume that teaching is necessary for learning to occur. This is a fallacy. Learning and teaching are different, and we focus on learning. While we certainly have people with                in-depth experience, senior level engineers, skilled facilitators, and so on, we don’t have teachers. A well designed learning environment causes a rapid transfer of knowledge from peers. As you learn, you will share what you know. This is a kind of “mutual exploration” of the knowledge. Trying to explain what you know challenges you to deepen your own understanding, even as you assist someone else with theirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because technology changes so quickly, knowing information isn’t enough. It doesn’t take long for today’s right answers to become obsolete. To prepare you, our learning facilitators focus on improving your problem-solving skills. Essentially, you learn
                how to learn. This way, you’re equipped with the skills that make lifelong learning attainable, something that’s critical to becoming a good developer.

            <div class="togglec">
              <p>
                We invest in you to learn as much as you need to attain and sustain a career as a software engineer. To support you, we hire expert practitioners to help you craft the best possible learning path towards your goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're looking for a set curriculum like the one you would find at a school or bootcamp, you won't find it here. We don't believe in a cookie-cutter approach to learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, we focus on two things: helping you learn how to learn, and providing a rich environment for you to practice and develop your craft with other motivated learners.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe the best answer to "what should I learn?" is "whatever the most skilled people around you know." So if you are surrounded by concert pianists, you're better off studying piano than the violin.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hire skilled full-stack JavaScript web developers to serve as expert  practitioners and mentors from whom you can learn skills and receive invaluable guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                So... will you learn languages like JavaScript? And databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB? And HTML and CSS and React and git and... The answer is: yes, of course. You certainly will learn these things, and many many more.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, though, you will learn the habits of mind of an engineer. You will learn how to build products with a team. You will learn how to evaluate your own skills and choose appropriate challenges to help you advance them. You will learn how to mentor other learners, not just because it's a Good Thing To Do, but also because the best way to test your knowledge is to teach it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, you will learn how to learn. After all, is there any more important skill?

            <div class="togglec">

              <p>
                No. Research shows that learning in a live, group context is accelerated. You learn more, you learn faster, and your conceptual understanding is deeper.

            <div class="togglec">

              <p>
                Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. There’s a big difference. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you must be coerced to learn. We’re not here to coerce. We only accept applicants who have a drive to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                As learners, we don’t focus on grades. Instead, we focus on improving our understanding and skills. Essentially, we believe that reality is the ultimate assessor.

              <p>
                Yes, really. We want you to focus on learning, not earning. A $1,500 monthly living allowance allows you to make learning your full-time job for 10 months. Remember, if you don’t succeed, then we don’t. So we take our investment in you seriously.

              <p>
                It’s in our best interest to see you thrive. We’re very careful to choose applicants who are committed to the process, and if you’re committed to learning, we’re determined to give you all the support you need to finish. In fact, that’s one reason we
                allow you to take extra time if necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                That all said, if you opt out, you will still owe the full tuition, and any living allowance you’ve received. On a case-by-case basis, we are willing to pause the program for those who face extenuating circumstances.

              <p>
                Yes, you’ll have an excellent opportunity to work on projects that will add to your portfolio. Some projects will be smaller, while others will be larger.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve designed our learning environment to focus on teamwork, so most of the projects are done in teams. However, there will be some opportunities to work on individual projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope by the end of your time at Learners Guild, you will be contributing to open source projects (and perhaps even to our own product codebase).

              <p>
                Good questions. The cost of attending Learners Guild is $28,000; however, there are no upfront costs. If a learner takes the maximum of the living allowance, that increases their cost of participation by an additional $20,000, bringing the total to $48,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a learner has transitioned out into the workforce with earnings over $50,000, they will be obligated to initiate the repayment of their tuition and living allowance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typical starting salaries are $70k to $95k a year. Learners have the option of paying back the loan in installments over a five year period.

                You’ll probably never stop asking this question. (We wish this program existed when we started our careers.) In fact, it’s our goal that you ask this every day you show up and find yourself learning in ways you never thought possible.

                We want you to ask this 40 weeks later, when you’ve landed a job you didn’t think you could have. And we want you to ask this 5, 10, and 20 years later… when you’re still in touch, and still getting support from the friends you made at Learners Guild.

            <div class="togglec">

              <p>
                <em>No.</em> We have specifically chosen to not provide job placement services. We made this decision because we want to ensure that <em>you</em> the learner remains our primary client. If we provided job placement services, our attention would be divided between satisfying businesses versus placing our complete focus on satisfying you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have designed our learning experience around real-life industry ready skills. After six months at Learners Guild, you will have developed a good portfolio of work. Our hope is at that point, you start interviewing for your full-time position.
              </p>
              <p>
                For us, “gaining full-time employment as an engineer” is another skill that you will be developing at Learners Guild. Over your last few months in the program, you will get better and better at this, up to the point where <em>you</em> will be the one deciding where you to go and to further grow your skills.

                Currently, no. While it’s possible to cover the basics in a shorter course, our goal is to have you walk out with a much deeper skillset than “the basics.” If we find a way to streamline our approach and still produce stellar results, we’ll certainly consider it.

                No. Our approach is strictly results oriented. There’s a lot of people with degrees, but no job to match it. It’s a common mistake to confuse a symbol for learning with the actual learning, itself.
