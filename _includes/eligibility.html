        <p class="lead">In order to be admitted to Learners Guild, applicants must meet the requirements listed.</p>

        <p class="lead">
          Beyond a common desire to become a premium software engineer, all of our learners share a drive to learn and grow in a mutually supportive environment, not just intellectually, but socially and emotionally as well. We expect a minimum level of personal development and maturity.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We look for a baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring software engineering for the first time. We are a learning collective
          that works best for advanced beginners.
