          <h3>Computational thinking</h3>

          <p class="lead"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">Computational thinking</a> is the range of cognitive abilities needed to program a computer. It includes abilities like logical reasoning, algorithm design, pattern recognition,
            and evaluating a series of sequential instructions.</p>

          <p class="lead"><em>To self-assess your computational thinking skills,</em> complete the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/tests/computer-test.htm">Computer Programming Aptitude Test</a> from the University of Kent. If your score is higher than 19, you’re
            definitely ready for Learners Guild.</p>

          <p class="lead">If your score is lower, you will want to practice more to build up your computational thinking ability. Luckily, computational thinking is a skill just like basketball or dance: the more you practice, the better you’ll get.</p>

        <div class="col_one_third col_last">
          <p class="lead">Here are some resources you can use to grow your computational thinking skills:</p>

          <h3>Basics of web development</h3>

          <p class="lead">The basics of web development covers topics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some conceptual understanding of how browsers and the web work.</p>

          <p class="lead"><em>To self-assess your web development skills,</em> try to complete this <a href="https://gist.github.com/lg-bot/d3653ebe023f0f515644">coding challenge to make a color picker</a> with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you can complete steps 2&#8211;4
            of this challenge in less than an hour with no outside help (except for Google, of course), you’re likely skilled enough in basic web development to join Learners Guild.</p>

          <p class="lead">If you aren’t able to complete the challenge, or if it was very difficult for you, then you will want to strengthen your web development skills.</p>
