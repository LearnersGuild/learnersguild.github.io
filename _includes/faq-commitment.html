        <p>In order to be admitted to Learners Guild, applicants must meet all of the requirements listed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Committed and absolutely sure you want to pursue a career as a full-time web developer</li>
            <li>Age 21 or older</li>
            <li>Oral and written proficiency in English</li>
            <li>Ability to participate full-time, in person, (M-F, 9:00am to 6:00pm) for 40-weeks</li>
            <li>Can type at least 30 words per minute</li>
            <li>Must be US citizen or permanent resident</li>
            <li>Current and anticipated financial obligations at levels where ISA repayment would not be overly burdensome</li> 
            <li>Has demonstrated sustained commitment over time such as several years of work or previous education experience</li>
            <li>Willing to aid others in their learning</li>
            <li>Able to give and receive feedback from others in a professional manner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond a desire to become a web developer, we look for baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring programming for the first time; we are a learning community that works best for advanced beginners.</p>
        <p>If you are just starting to explore programming, you can take advantage of the many freely available resources for beginners.</p>

        What's the time commitment? What are the days/hours like?

      <div id="q3b" class="collapse answer">
        <p>Learners Guild is a full time commitment. We all agree to be onsite from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Learners who want to put in a few more hours have the option to arrive as early as 7am and stay as late at 10pm, or come in on the weekends. Of course want you to make the most of your time at the Guild, but we also believe it is important to live a balanced life.</p>

        <p>Yes. You're welcome to use your own laptop, as long as it's a Mac. Everyone at Learners Guild uses Mac computers, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with your team, and get support with your computer should something go wrong, if you are all using the same platform.</p>

        <p>It’s in our best interest to see you thrive -- after all, if you don't succeed, we don't either. As a result, we’re very careful to choose applicants who demonstrate a serious commitment to the program and the process.</p>
        <p>However if you opt out, you will still be contractually obligated to repay both your Tuition and Living Allowance ISAs, which will be prorated based on your time at the Guild (details on prorating are set forth in the Enrollment Agreement). On a case-by-case basis, we may pause a Learner's participation in the program and allow them to return, but only under extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of Learners Guild staff.</p>

      <div id="q3g" class="collapse answer">
        <p>If you leave the program during the first 5 weeks, the Tuition and Living Allowance ISAs will be cancelled and you will not owe any amounts to Learners Guild. If you leave the program after the first 5 weeks, the terms in the question above apply, and your ISAs repayments will be prorated according to your time spent at Learners Guild.</p>

      <div id="q3h" class="collapse answer">
        <p>If you elect to attend school after your time in the Learners Guild program (in lieu of working), your ISA will be paused (similar to in-school deferment) and not be in payment status for up to an additional 7 years.  Your ISA payment term will be extended by the amount of time you are in school.</p>

      <div id="q3i" class="collapse answer">
        <p>If you voluntarily leave the workforce, your ISA will be paused, that is, not in repayment status, for up to 7 years. At the end of this term, or when you reenter the workforce, whichever comes first, your ISA repayment term will be reactivated with the original income share percentage, maximum payment cap, and 36 month payment period in tact.</p>
