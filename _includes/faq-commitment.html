  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3a">What do I need to commit to and what are the requirements to attend?</button>
  <div id="q3a" class="collapse">
    <p>In order to be admitted to Learners Guild, applicants must meet all of the requirements listed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Committed to pursuing a full-time career as a web developer / software engineer</li>
      <li>Willing to aid others in their learning</li>
      <li>Age 21 or older</li>
      <li>Oral and written proficiency in English</li>
      <li>Has several years' employment and/or community service experience</li>
      <li>Participate full-time, in person, (m-f, 8:30am to 6:00pm) for 40-weeks</li>
      <li>Can type at least 30 words per minute</li>
      <li>Must be US citizen or permanent resident</li>
      <li>Current and anticipated financial obligations at a reasonable threshold</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond a common desire to become a software engineer, all of our Learners share a drive to learn and grow in a mutually supportive environment, not just intellectually, but socially and emotionally as well. We expect a minimum level of personal development and maturity.
      We look for a baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring programming for the first time. We are a learning collective that works best for advanced beginners.
      If you are just starting to explore programming, you should take advantage of the many freely available resources for beginners so that you can be best prepared. We recommend <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Shay Howe’s HTML & CSS lessons</a>, the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS</a> course on Khan Academy, and the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website">Make a Website</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website">Make an Interactive Website tracks</a> on Codecademy.

  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3b">What's the time commitment? What are the days/hours like?</button>
  <div id="q3b" class="collapse">
    <p>Learners Guild is a full time commitment. 8.30 AM to 6.00 PM, Monday through Friday. Learners who want to put in a few more hours have the option of arriving as early as 7am and staying as late at 10pm. But we all agree to be onsite between 8:30 am - 6:00 pm, and while we want you to make the most of your time at the Guild, we also believe it is important to live a balanced life.</p>
  </div>
    
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3c">What about during the holiday season? Do we get time off?</button>
  <div id="q3c" class="collapse">
    <p>We'll take off one week for winter holiday season/new year's, and another week during the summer. If your time at the Guild crosses over any of these weeks you will have time off,  otherwise we expect you not to take vacations during your 40 weeks. </p>

  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3d">Where does Learners Guild meet?</button>
  <div id="q3d" class="collapse">
    <p>We have a great office space in Old Oakland, centrally located and accessible by public transportation.</p>
  </div>
    
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3e">Do I need my own computer?</button>
  <div id="q3e" class="collapse">
    <p>Yes. If you don’t already have a computer for the program, you'll have the option to request a modified living stipend so that you can receive additional funds to purchase one in the first month of the program. Note that this choice will increase the repayment percentage for your living allowance ISA. That said, you're welcome to use your own laptop, as long as it's a Mac. Everyone at Learners Guild uses Mac computers, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with your team if you are all using the same platform.</p>
  </div>
    
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3f">What happens if I quit the program before the end of 40-weeks?</button>
  <div id="q3f" class="collapse">
    <p>It’s in our best interest to see you thrive. If you don't succeed, we don't. We’re very careful to choose applicants who are committed to the process, and if you’re committed to learning, we’re determined to give you all the support you need to finish. That said, if you opt out, you will still be obligated under your income share agreement that will be prorated based on your time at the Guild (details on prorating are set forth in the Enrollment Agreement). Similarly, if you have opted for a living allowance you will be obligated under your ISA, adjusted for the amount of living allowance you received. On a case-by-case basis, we may pause a Learner's participation in the program and allow them to return, but only under extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of Learners Guild staff.</p>

  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3g">What happens if I leave the Learners Guild program shortly after I start?</button>
  <div id="q3g" class="collapse">
    <p>If you leave the program during the first 25 days, the ISAs for the stipend and/or the program fees will be cancelled and you will not owe any amounts under the ISAs. If you leave the program after the first 25 days your ISAs will be prorated according to our refund policy set forth in the learners guild Enrollment Agreement.

  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3h">What happens if I transfer or go to grad school?</button>
  <div id="q3h" class="collapse">
    <p>If you elect to attend school after your time in the Learners Guild program in lieu of working, your ISA will toll or be paused (similar to in-school deferment) and not be in a payment status for up to an additional seven (7) years.  Your ISA payment term will be extended by the amount of time you are in school.</p>
  </div>
    
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3i">What if I take time off to start a family or travel?</button>
  <div id="q3i" class="collapse">
    <p>If you voluntarily leave the workforce, your ISA will be paused and not be in payment status for up to an additional seven (7) years.  Your ISA payment term will be extended by the amount of time you take off. However, your income share percentage and the maximum amount of your payment will not change because of this pause.</p>
