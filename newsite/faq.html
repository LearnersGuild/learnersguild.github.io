<h3>A guild is an old idea, set to be the future of learning.</h3>
<p>In the distant past, if you wanted to learn a trade, you'd join a guild. 
It wasn't theoretical, it was experential.  Young apprentices would 
work under proved masters, each generation investing in and giving back to the one that followed. 
Guilds not only kept their crafts alive, they formed a society of mutual help and companionship.</p>

<h3>A guild is an old idea, set to be the future of learning.</h3>
<p>Today's guilds are learning communities entirely different from typical schools. 
If you want to take on all the financial risk and go it alone, you go to a college or a bootcamp. 
If you want to be part of a community that loves its craft and those who practice it, 
if you want to be lifted by others, and to lift others with you, you join a guild.</p>

	<h1>How the Money Works</h1>		
			
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2a">What does Learners Guild cost? What if I can’t pay upfront? If you’re investing in me, how do you get paid?</button>
<div id="q2a" class="collapse">
<p>Good Questions. We know it's unusual, but program fees for Learners Guild do not have to be paid upfront. 

People who want to, can pay the upfront price of $29,750 for the program, but most people opt to pay for the Learners Guild program through an Income Sharing Agreement (ISA), where you will contribute 12.5% of your salary (or up to 21% if you receive a living stipend) for the first three years’ of employment. The typical starting salary for a junior web developer / software engineer is $75K to $95K per year.

As a Public Benefit Corporation, we want to make Learners Guild accessible to everyone, no matter their ability to pay upfront fees. This means we’re quite literally investing in you: we want you to get an awesome high-paying job, and we only get paid if you succeed.  We’re betting on you and our ability to help you reach your potential, so if you don’t make over $50,000 after your time at the Guild, we don’t make a dime. </p>
</div>
			
			
			
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2b">What is an Income Sharing Agreement (ISA)?</button>
<div id="q2b" class="collapse">

<p>In general terms, an Income Share Agreement (ISA) is a contractual agreement in which an individual receives funding in exchange for an agreed upon percentage of post-program income over a defined number of years. At Learners Guild we offer 2 ISAs, one that covers the program fees and another that covers the provision of the living allowance, both are optional.
How much funding is available for individual learners?
Individual funding amounts vary depending whether a Learner elects to enter into an ISA for the program fees, and/or an ISA for living allowance (which can also cover the cost of a laptop). The ISA for the program fees covers the entire $29,750 funding amount for the program and requires an income share of 12.5% for 3 years, once you complete the program.  And, the ISA for the living allowance, allows the Learner to receive up to $1,500 / month (which equates to $346.15/week) to pay for living expenses -- rent, computer, food, etc.-- during the program in exchange for up to 8.5% of income for 3 years.  </p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2c">$1,500/mo living allowance? Really?  Is it mandatory or optional?</button>
<div id="q2c" class="collapse">
<p>Yes, really. The $1,500 monthly living allowance is intended to help defray your cost of living while you're at Learners Guild. As much as possible, we want you to focus on learning, not earning.  Learners can elect to enter into an ISA for up to $1,500/month in living allowance, but it is totally optional and you can take less or none if you don’t need the full amount. $1,500/month equates to $346.15/week and there is also an option to receive an additional $1,846 to cover the cost of a laptop. Payments for the living allowance are made to Learners every 2 weeks, in advance, starting on the second Friday of the program.
</p>
</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2d">What are the benefits to learners?</button>
<div id="q2d" class="collapse">
<p>The Learners Guild ISAs offer learners an alternative to taking on debt to cover the program fee and/or debt to cover living expenses. Debt creates substantial risks if the individual cannot afford the payments, whereas ISA payments adjust according to levels of income. In addition, the ISA payments for Learners Guild are subject to a minimum income threshold of $50,000, and a maximum payment cap equal to two (2) times the amount funded, so students who opt into the ISA will not pay if they do not meet the minimum income threshold, while those who earn a substantial amount of income will not pay above the maximum capped amount</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2e">Why is Learners Guild offering ISAs to students?</button>
<div id="q2e" class="collapse">
<p>The ISA allows Learners to have an option not to have to pay the program fees upfront. In addition to making Learners Guild accessible to anyone, regardless of financial means, we also like it because it aligns our success with our Learners.  We only succeed and are able to invest in future Learners if people make it through our program, get a well-paying job, and make payments on their ISAs. Finally, we feel ISAs are an alternative funding option for Learners, one that could reduce debt and financial risk.</p>
</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2f">Will the amount I am responsible to pay under the ISA grow through interest expense until I begin making payments or by my occasional underpayment?</button>
<div id="q2f" class="collapse">
<p>No. The ISA possesses no interest rate, which is different than student loans. The amount you are required to pay (Income Share multiplied by your earned income) will only grow due to the growth rate of the amount of the income you earn, but the income share level percentage will not change during the term of the ISA.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2g">What are the risks to learners?</button>
<div id="q2g" class="collapse">
<p>The amount of payment is based on income, so if a Learner commits to an ISA and earns a high income after graduation they may pay more than they would have if they had paid for the $29,750 in program fees upfront, had obtained the living allowance amounts from another source, or had obtained conventional debt for either the program fees or the living allowance. However, the ISAs cap the total amount to be paid, so no student will ever pay more than the agreed upon amount.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2h">Is the income share calculated from my gross or net pay (before or after taxes)?</button>
<div id="q2h" class="collapse">
<p>Gross pay. Before taxes.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2i">If my salary goes up, does the percentage of my income sharing stay the same?</button>
<div id="q2i" class="collapse">
<p>Yes. The percentage is fixed over the payback period, which is 3 years if you complete the program. Regardless if your salary goes up or down, the terms of the ISA remain the same.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2j">How will Learners know if an ISA is a good option for them?</button>
<div id="q2j" class="collapse">
<p>ISAs are among many options that are available for funding, including whether to pay the program fees upfront. Learners should research which options work best for their individual situations.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2k">What factors should learners consider when deciding whether to accept the stipend and/or pay the program fees upfront, or to apply for the ISAs or other financing options?</button>
<div id="q2k" class="collapse">
<p>A learner's decision about whether to accept the living allowance, whether to pay the program fees upfront, or whether to finance all or a part of their living expenses or the program fees should include an assessment of all of the options available based on their individual financial situation.  Learners Guild encourages all learners to consult with trusted advisors and consider how an ISA compares to other financing options.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2l">Which learners will be eligible to apply for an ISA?</button>
<div id="q2l" class="collapse">

</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2m">How can Learners Guild learners apply for an ISA or get more information?</button>
<div id="q2m" class="collapse">
<p>It is recommended that interested learners discuss ISAs with a financial aid advisor, parents and/or guardians before deciding if an ISA is a possible funding solution for them. The application process for Learners Guild is on a rolling basis and new start almost every week. If you have questions about the application process, please contact enrollment@learnersguild.org.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2n">What types of payment terms will be offered for learners?</button>
<div id="q2n" class="collapse">
<p>The term length and percentage are set to be competitive with current consumer finance options. Depending on the learner’s post-program income, the amount paid back on the ISA may be either lower or higher than the funding amount for the student.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2o">Following the end of a learner’s participation in the program, when does the ISA payment plan take effect?</button>
<div id="q2o" class="collapse">
<p>Students are afforded a three-month grace period after they complete or withdrawal from participation in the Learners Guild program before payments are required.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2p">Am I required to fully pay the money that was given to me under the ISA?</button>
<div id="q2p" class="collapse">
<p>An ISA recipient is required to pay the agreed upon percentage of post-program income for the prescribed term of the contract. After making successful payments over that term, no additional payments are required even if they have paid less than the amount of funding they received.</p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2q">Is there an option to "pay off" your financial obligation to Learners Guild early (i.e. before the 36-month repayment period is over)?</button>
<div id="q2q" class="collapse">
<p>The short answer to this question is "no", and the reason is that you are not borrowing from Learners Guild but instead receiving an investment. ]Learners Guild is making an investment in you in exchange for a share of your income for a specific period of time (36-months if you complete the program), only if you make over $50,000. There is a limit on your payments, so if you reach the payment cap during your payback period your obligation is complete, but there is no benefit to paying towards that cap early. </p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2r">Isn’t this too good to be true?</button>
<div id="q2r" class="collapse">
<p>You’ll probably never stop asking this question. (We wish this program existed when we started our careers.) In fact, it’s our goal that you ask this every day you show up and find yourself learning in ways you never thought possible. We want you to ask this 40 weeks later, when you’ve landed a job you didn’t think you could have. And we want you to ask this 5, 10, and 20 years later… when you’re still in touch, and still getting support from the friends you made at Learners Guild.</p>

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3a">WWhat do I need to commit to and what are the requirements to attend?
</button>
<div id="q3a" class="collapse">
<p>In order to be admitted to Learners Guild, applicants must meet all of the requirements listed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Committed to pursuing a full-time career as a web developer / software engineer</li>
<li>Willing to aid others in their learning</li>
<li>Age 21 or older</li>
<li>Oral and written proficiency in English</li>
<li>Has several years' employment and/or community service experience</li>
<li>Participate full-time, in person, (m-f, 8:30am to 6:00pm) for 40-weeks</li>
<li>Can type at least 30 words per minute</li>
<li>Must be US citizen or permanent resident</li>
<li>Current and anticipated financial obligations at a reasonable threshold</li>
</ul>

	<p>
Beyond a common desire to become a software engineer, all of our Learners share a drive to learn and grow in a mutually supportive environment, not just intellectually, but socially and emotionally as well. We expect a minimum level of personal development and maturity.
We look for a baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring programming for the first time. We are a learning collective that works best for advanced beginners.
If you are just starting to explore programming, you should take advantage of the many freely available resources for beginners so that you can be best prepared. We recommend <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Shay Howe’s HTML & CSS lessons</a>, the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS</a> course on Khan Academy, and the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website">Make a Website</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website">Make an Interactive Website tracks</a> on Codecademy.

<p>Learners Guild is a full time commitment. 8.30 AM to 6.00 PM, Monday through Friday. Learners who want to put in a few more hours have the option of arriving as early as 7am and staying as late at 10pm. But we all agree to be onsite between 8:30 am - 6:00 pm, and while we want you to make the most of your time at the Guild, we also believe it is important to live a balanced life.</p>

	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3e">Do I need my own computer?</button>
<div id="q3e" class="collapse">
<p>Yes. If you don’t already have a computer for the program, you'll have the option to request a modified living stipend so that you can receive additional funds to purchase one in the first month of the program. Note that this choice will increase the repayment percentage for your living allowance ISA.

That said, you're welcome to use your own laptop, as long as it's a Mac. Everyone at Learners Guild uses Mac computers, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with your team if you are all using the same platform.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3f">What happens if I quit the program before the end of 40-weeks?
</button>
<div id="q3f" class="collapse">
<p>It’s in our best interest to see you thrive. If you don't succeed, we don't. We’re very careful to choose applicants who are committed to the process, and if you’re committed to learning, we’re determined to give you all the support you need to finish. That said, if you opt out, you will still be obligated under your income share agreement that will be prorated based on your time at the Guild (details on prorating are set forth in the Enrollment Agreement). Similarly, if you have opted for a living allowance you will be obligated under your ISA, adjusted for the amount of living allowance you received. On a case-by-case basis, we may pause a Learner's participation in the program and allow them to return, but only under extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of Learners Guild staff.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4a">How will I learn? How will I choose projects or goals?
</button>
<div id="q4a" class="collapse">
<p>At Learners Guild we follow the principles of cognitive apprenticeship to design a system for effective skills training. Much of all learning at the Guild takes place in team projects, similar to the way that actual software applications are built.

The essence of our model is that instead of many people learning only from one person, every learner is learning from other learners and, in turn, passing on their skills and knowledge. There will always be "experts" who you can ask the most difficult questions, but in a lot of cases you will be learning from other, more experienced Learners. Because new Learners start every week, there is always a range of skills and experience in the room, and we’ll help you use this range to your advantage.

Our system also incorporates game-based learning so you receive stats and feedback to let you track your progress, and let you know where to focus your efforts to improve. Each week you choose projects and goals that are both relevant and challenging, so that you're always working with others on interesting problems that push you into your "Proximal Zone of Development". Each team is assigned a more-experienced team lead who guides and supports the project and the team's learning.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4b">Isn’t "Learning Collective" just a fancy word for "school" or "bootcamp"?
</button>
<div id="q4b" class="collapse">

<p>Not to us. We're creating a dynamic learning environment, but we're not creating another school or coding bootcamp. We know a lot about bootcamps; many of the folks on our team were pioneers of that industry. But we weren’t satisfied with the results. While bootcamps do a decent job at helping students enter the software industry, we think we can do better at setting Learners up for rapidly advancing careers and longer term success. A Learners Guild we are betting that after your time here, you will have coding skills that are more advanced than someone with a Computer Science degree, or a bootcamp graduate. </p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4c">Are there teachers?
</button>
<div id="q4c" class="collapse">
<p>At Learners Guild everyone is both a student and a teacher. While we certainly have people with in-depth industry experience, senior level engineers, and skilled facilitators, we don’t have “teachers”. You'll be collaborating every day with people ahead of you in the program, and people who started after you. As you learn, you'll share what you know. At Learners Guild, knowledge spreads like wildfire.

A well-designed learning environment causes a rapid transfer of knowledge between experts and peers. Because technology changes so quickly, knowing information isn’t enough. It doesn’t take long for today’s right answers to be obsolete tomorrow. To prepare you, we focus not only on what you learn, but how you learn it, developing meta-learning and problem-solving skills. Your ability to continue growing and refining your craft will set you up for sustained success as a software developer. Learners Guild graduates are lifelong learners.

</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4d">What will I learn? What technical skills are covered?
</button>
<div id="q4d" class="collapse">
<p>We invest in you to learn as much as you need to attain and sustain a career as a software engineer. To support you, we hire expert practitioners to help you craft the best possible learning path towards your goal.
If you're looking for a set curriculum like the one you would find at a school or bootcamp, you won't find it here. We don't believe in a cookie-cutter approach to learning.
Instead, we focus on two things: helping you learn how to learn, and providing a rich environment for you to practice and develop your craft with other motivated learners.
We believe the best answer to "what should I learn?" is "whatever the most skilled people around you know." So if you are surrounded by concert pianists, you're better off studying piano than the violin.
We hire skilled full-stack JavaScript web developers to serve as expert practitioners and mentors from whom you can learn skills and receive invaluable guidance.
So... will you learn languages like JavaScript? And databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB? And HTML and CSS and React and git and... The answer is: yes, of course. You certainly will learn these things, and many many more.
More importantly, though, you will learn the habits of mind of an engineer. You will learn how to build products with a team. You will learn how to evaluate your own skills and choose appropriate challenges to help you advance them. You will learn how to mentor other learners, not just because it's a Good Thing To Do, but also because the best way to test your knowledge is to teach it.
Finally, you will learn how to learn. After all, is there any more important skill?

</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4e">Why JavaScript?</button>
<div id="q4e" class="collapse">
<p>There are plenty of great coding languages out there, and while JavaScript isn't the only option, it is a solid choice for people starting their careers in software.

Here’s why: (1) JavaScript is ubiquitous on the web and expanding rapidly to other platforms, so demand for JS developers is unlikely to stop growing anytime soon; (2) the JavaScript community is robust and there are lots of amazing resources for continued learning and development; (3) and finally, JavaScript is (relatively) simple and straightforward.

This process is crucial to our environment. Every learner will start as a team member, but before long they will lead teams as well. In this way, all Learners will not only learn by doing, but also by demonstrating and explaining their skills to others.

However, the team environment is not the only environment where mentorship takes place. We are a learning collective, which means that everyone involved is available for support and guidance when you need it. We believe in being generous with knowledge, and that an environment of shared curiosity and open information is the best place to learn.

	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4g">Do you have an online option?</button>
<div id="q4g" class="collapse">
<p>We don't. The power of our model is in the real-time, face-to-face interactions you'll have with people every day. Research shows that learning in a live, group context is accelerated. You will learn more, you will learn faster, and your conceptual understanding will be deeper.

</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4h">Do you have a shorter immersion course?</button>
<div id="q4h" class="collapse">
<p>No. While it’s possible to cover the basics in a shorter course, our goal is to have you walk out with a much deeper skillset than “the basics.” If we find a way to streamline our approach and still produce stellar results, we’ll certainly consider it, but for now it’s 40 weeks.

	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4i">Will we be graded?</button>
<div id="q4i" class="collapse">
<p>Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you need to be coerced to learn. We’re not here to coerce. We believe in your innate drive to learn and grow, and design our approach around it. We don't care about what grades you got in school. We care about your drive, your potential, what you understand and what you can do. We think reality is the ultimate test.

	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4j">How will Learners know if an ISA is a good option for them?</button>
<div id="q4j" class="collapse">
<p>ISAs are among many options that are available for funding, including whether to pay the program fees upfront. Learners should research which options work best for their individual situations.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4k">What factors should learners consider when deciding whether to accept the stipend and/or pay the program fees upfront, or to apply for the ISAs or other financing options?</button>
<div id="q4k" class="collapse">
<p>A learner's decision about whether to accept the living allowance, whether to pay the program fees upfront, or whether to finance all or a part of their living expenses or the program fees should include an assessment of all of the options available based on their individual financial situation.  Learners Guild encourages all learners to consult with trusted advisors and consider how an ISA compares to other financing options.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4l">Which learners will be eligible to apply for an ISA?</button>
<div id="q4l" class="collapse">
<p>Any Learner that is admitted to the program is eligible for an ISA. </p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4m">How can Learners Guild learners apply for an ISA or get more information?</button>
<div id="q4m" class="collapse">
<p>It is recommended that interested learners discuss ISAs with a financial aid advisor, parents and/or guardians before deciding if an ISA is a possible funding solution for them. The application process for Learners Guild is on a rolling basis and new start almost every week. If you have questions about the application process, please contact enrollment@learnersguild.org.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4n">What types of payment terms will be offered for learners?</button>
<div id="q4n" class="collapse">
<p>The term length and percentage are set to be competitive with current consumer finance options. Depending on the learner’s post-program income, the amount paid back on the ISA may be either lower or higher than the funding amount for the student.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4o">Following the end of a learner’s participation in the program, when does the ISA payment plan take effect?</button>
<div id="q4o" class="collapse">
<p>Students are afforded a three-month grace period after they complete or withdrawal from participation in the Learners Guild program before payments are required.</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4p">Am I required to fully pay the money that was given to me under the ISA?</button>
<div id="q4p" class="collapse">
<p>An ISA recipient is required to pay the agreed upon percentage of post-program income for the prescribed term of the contract. After making successful payments over that term, no additional payments are required even if they have paid less than the amount of funding they received.</p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4q">Is there an option to "pay off" your financial obligation to Learners Guild early (i.e. before the 36-month repayment period is over)?</button>
<div id="q4q" class="collapse">
<p>The short answer to this question is "no", and the reason is that you are not borrowing from Learners Guild but instead receiving an investment. ]Learners Guild is making an investment in you in exchange for a share of your income for a specific period of time (36-months if you complete the program), only if you make over $50,000. There is a limit on your payments, so if you reach the payment cap during your payback period your obligation is complete, but there is no benefit to paying towards that cap early. </p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4r">Isn’t this too good to be true?</button>
<div id="q4r" class="collapse">
<p>Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you need to be coerced to learn. We’re not here to coerce.

<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5b">Who else is attending? What kind of people will I meet?
</button>
<div id="q5b" class="collapse">

<p>At Learners Guild you’ll meet other adults like yourself, from a wide range of backgrounds, who share your dedication, passion, and curiosity. Check out the videos on the site and in our Community section to see some of the current Learners at the Guild.
</p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5c">What if I already have a degree? Is Learners Guild still for me?
</button>
<div id="q5c" class="collapse">
<p>Absolutely. We designed Learners Guild for degree holders and non-degree holders alike. Anyone who wants to be a professional web developer / software engineer is encouraged to apply.


</p>
</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5d">Once I fill out the application, then what happens? Do I have to interview for a spot in the program? How long does the application process take?

</button>
<div id="q5d" class="collapse">
<p>There are three more steps in our application process:

1) Once you submit an application, if you have met all of the requirements, you will receive an invitation to schedule a video interview with a member of The Guild. We typically have interview slots available within two weeks of when your application is qualified. This interview is focused on fitness with our community culture and with our learning model.
2) After that initial interview, we will let you know within 24 hours if you are being invited to take the Tech Quiz. And don’t worry, it’s a quiz and not a test, so you can take it more than once, if needed.
3) Once you pass the Tech Quiz, you'll be invited to an onsite Enrollment Game where you will meet in person with other applicants, current Learners, and Learners Guild staff. The Enrollment Game mimics what it's like to learn at The Guild - it gives you the opportunity to try out our learning model and some of our cultural practices, and it’s also a good way for us to assess if you are good fit for the program.  We currently host Enrollment Games every two weeks.

After the Enrollment Game, we inform candidates if they have been accepted into The Guild within one week.  So, the whole process from submitting your application to receiving your acceptance notification can take 4-8 weeks.     


</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5e">What documents do I have to sign for the ISAs?</button>
<div id="q5e" class="collapse">
<p>You will execute 1 or 2 ISAs, depending on if you opt to not pay up front fees and/or take a living allowance stipend.  The ISAs are issued by subsidiaries of Learners Guild. Also, you should be aware that another company, VEMO Education (www.vemo.com), will be responsible administering the ISAs and collecting payments. VEMO is a pioneer in ISAs, and has worked extensively with Learners Guild to make them available to Learners.

</p>
</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5f">I am applying from out of town, can I join the enrollment game remotely?
</button>
<div id="q5f" class="collapse">
<p>No. Unfortunately, you need to be in person for that part of the enrollment process.


</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5g">Can I visit the Guild to check it out?</button>
<div id="q5g" class="collapse">
<p>Yes, we encourage you to come to one of our info sessions, where you will meet Learners and our team. However, we can not presently allow for unscheduled visits, as it is distracting for our current Learners.

	<h1>Post Program Matters</h1>		
			
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6a">Do you help with job placement?
</button>
<div id="q6a" class="collapse">
<p>We help get you ready for the job market, but we intentionally decided to not provide job placement services because we want to ensure that you the Learner remains our primary client. If we provided job placement services, our attention would be divided between satisfying businesses versus placing our complete focus on satisfying you.

For us, applying and gaining full-time employment as a software developer is another key skill that you will be developing at Learners Guild. Over your last few months in the program, you can sign up for different types of practice job interviews so you can get better and better, to the point where, hopefully, you will be the one deciding where you'll go to further grow your skills.


</p>
</div>
			
			
			
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6b">Will I earn a certificate or degree?
</button>
<div id="q6b" class="collapse">

<p>No. Our approach is results oriented, not degree oriented. There are a lot of people with degrees, but no job to match.  We think it’s a common mistake to confuse a symbol for learning, like a degree, with learning itself.

Learners Guild turns that around: if you don’t end up in a well-paying job, we don’t get paid. Our focus is on getting you ready for the workforce by helping you develop your skills, which are demonstrated by your ability to create a portfolio of work and gain employment.

</p>
</div>
	
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6c">Will I end up with a portfolio?
</button>
<div id="q6c" class="collapse">
<p>Yes, you’ll have an excellent opportunity to build a coding portfolio, showcasing a diverse array of projects that you worked on over the course of the program. 

We’ve designed our learning environment to focus on teamwork, so many of the projects are done in teams and range in size and scope. However, there will also be time to work on individual projects, so you gain the skills and confidence to know that you can code. 

We hope by the end of your time at Learners Guild, you will be contributing to open source projects (and perhaps even to our own product codebase).

</p>
</div>
	
<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6d">Will learners be required or steered toward certain types of employment?

</button>
<div id="q6d" class="collapse">
<p>There are no requirements stipulating the nature or type of employment that Learners choose after the program.
     


</p>
</div>
	
	<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6e">What's my financial commitment after the program is over? </button>
<div id="q6e" class="collapse">
<p>Depending on how much stipend you chose, your commitment is to make payments on your ISAs ranging from 12.5% to 21% of your gross salary for 3 years, if you make $50,000 or more.  It is important that you strive to live up to this commitment, because we are basing our whole system and model on the bet that payments from our successful Learners will provide the money needed to finance the next generation of Learners.  We believe in paying it forward and hope that after your experience at the Guild, you will too.
