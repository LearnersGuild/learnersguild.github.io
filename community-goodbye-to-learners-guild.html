        <p>For the past 4 months, I have been in an intensive software engineering apprenticeship program called Learner’s Guild in Oakland, CA. Since I am leaving the 10 month program early, it still doesn’t feel real that I won’t be working alongside the talented people that have been cheering me on for the last few months. From officially making the decision to take the next step in my career, to trying to understand a new code base with live users in a week, my colleagues and mentors have seen me at my proudest and most delirious moments.</p>
        <p>During the transformation that I’ve gone through over the last few months, Learner’s Guild has come to feel like home and my colleagues like family. Aside from the chaos that naturally comes with any Bay Area start up (which added to my growth as an engineer), I have never experienced a healthier learning environment, especially in the technology field. For the first time in my life, I had everything I needed to learn. At 24 years old, it was a bittersweet discovery to finally know what that felt like.</p>
        <p>If you know me personally, you’ve probably heard me talk about my experience with a toxic learning environment while I was earning my B.S. in Computer Science at Sonoma State University. If you don’t know me personally but are a minority in tech, I’m sure you can fill in the gaps with your own story. I’ll save the details for another post, but in short I left Sonoma State University in 2015 with an expensive piece of paper and a lot of trauma. I have been trying to find my feet in a field that is just as toxic as my college learning environment ever since, so you can probably guess that wasn’t a good combination. I had developed such an unhealthy relationship with my line of work that some days, even a simple syntax error could send me spiraling into full blown anxiety attack.</p>
        <p>This is where Learner’s Guild comes in. After a lot of brainstorming and conversations with my colleagues, I’ve realized there is no succinct way to describe the program. To me, it’s like I’ve had a broken arm for the last five years and I am just now getting treatment. Scratch that, I just now have everything I need to learn how to mend it myself. During the last few months, I have refined my technical knowledge and sharpened my understanding of what defines a skilled engineer. Equally as crucial since I am a minority in tech, I have strengthened coping mechanisms and survival skills to maintain a healthy relationship with the toxic environment that is a reality in this industry.</p>
        <p>Without Learner’s Guild, I am certain that I would have been one of the (queer, disabled) women that quickly falls out of the technology pipeline early on. I whole-heartedly respect the women who do leave, as staying in this industry to follow my passion has been one of the hardest decisions of my life, and I know I will fight with this decision for the rest of my career. So, thank you to all of my mentors and colleagues who have supported me during these last few months as I re-constructed my identity as a software engineer. I don’t need to say it, but I could not have succeeded without each and every one of you. This is only the beginning of my journey as an engineer and I am excited to have your support as I take the next step in following my passion.</p>
        <p>In terms of my next step, stay tuned to hear the details!</p>
