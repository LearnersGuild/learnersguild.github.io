                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>It began in 2012 when Shereef Bishay, a programmer and entrepreneur, realized there had to be a better way for his friends to learn to code.  At the time they were facing four years in college, hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and spent little time working on real world projects.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="item picture2">
          <div class="container">
            <div class="container-fluid">
              <div class="row block5">
                <p>Shereef conceived of a very different experience and invited a few of his friends to join. Called Dev Bootcamp, it was a 10-week immersive program to teach people the skills they need to enter the booming tech sector at a fraction of the cost. It worked, his friends got jobs, and the idea caught on. In fact, within a few years, bootcamps trained tens of thousands of aspiring engineers and gave tech companies a new pipeline for talent.</p>

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <div class="row block5">
                <p>But Shereef wasn't satisfied. He understood that even though bootcamps are far cheaper than college, they still aren't accessible to most; millions can't afford to take on any debt at all. In fact, millions can't spend time in school not earning an income. Not to mention people of color and women are still greatly under-represented int he tech industry - a problem bootcamps aren't built to solve.</p>

              <div class="row block5">
                <p>So in 2015, Shereef and some of the best and brightest in the field decided to start something even more radical: a learning community that is both more inclusive and more intensive. Designed for people who have the drive but just need a real opportunity.</p>

                <p>Learners Guild pushes aside all assumptions about education and starts from the scratch. We do away with tuition, grades, and competition. In its place, we build in support, hands-on real-world challenges and a learning environment that's safe and collaborative. In the process, Learners Guild doesn't just widen the circle of opportunity - we're creating a radically accessible on-ramp for people just like you.</p>
