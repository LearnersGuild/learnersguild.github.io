<h2 class="divcenter bottommargin font-body" style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 40px;">School? No. We're not a school.<br>Bootcamp? Nope. Better.</h2>

<p class="lead divcenter bottommargin" style="max-width: 800px;"><p>We’ve done coding schools. We’ve built boot camps. Turns out, there’s a better way. A teaching environment is not the same as a <em>learning</em> one. And taking out a school loan is not the same as having a community invest in your success. If you’re passionate about learning to code, then Learner’s Guild is passionate about investing in you.</p>
