### You say Learner's Guild is an "Accelerated Learning Community." Isn't that just a fancy way of saying it's a school?
*No.* Hell, no. Schools are... old school. Not in a good way. The top-down (teacher-student) learning approach embraced by most colleges is out-dated, slow, and inefficient at best. In addition, schools profit off of students whether students succeed or fail.

### So is Learner's Guild a kind of Boot Camp?
You're getting closer, but you're not there yet. Learner's Guild is longer than typical boot camps, more collaborative, and far more comprehensive. Unlike schools and bootcamps, Learner's Guild is also designed to succeed only if our players succeed. We've raised the stakes for ourselves in order to ensure we provide you with the best possible learning environment.


### So what is an "Accelerated Learning Community?"
You can think of an accelerated learning community as an environment. Like a room. If you put building blocks and art supplies and legos into a room, you don't have to teach kids how to build things. As soon as they walk in, they start creating. Why? Because the environment practically demands it of them. Whether you're 6 or 60. It's just what human brains do.

And learning is inherently better this way. In fact, the more fun, engaging, and collaborative an activity, the more you push through tough challenges to enter a into mental state called *deep learning.* And you want that. Learner's Guild "environment" does this with 3 key components:

+ The materials, skills map, and core content (like the building blocks in the room)
+ Being surrounded by a community of curious, collaborative learners
+ Being supported, guided, and challenged by facilitators who encourage you to unlock your own *unique* style of coding.

That's why we call it a community. You and your fellow learners are a critical part of creating the Accelerated Learning Community that we offer.

### Are there teachers?
Not exactly. Teachers often just feed you information and "answers." Learning and teaching are different, and we focus on learning. So we don't have "teachers" in the traditional sense of the word. We have *mentors* who guide you into teaching yourself the information and answers you need. Because technology changes so quickly, knowing information and answers isn't enough. In 5 years, that info will be obsolete. So our facilitators focus on improving your problem-solving practices, so you learn how to learn. This way, your skills and knowledge stays all freshy fresh and up-to-date, which is critical to becoming a good developer.

### Why do you call students "Learners" or "Players?"
Yeah. Research shows that learning isn't very effective in a top-down approach found in teacher-student relationships. In reality, anyone can learn from anyone. Both teachers and students can learn from other students. And in fact, sharing what you've learned with your peers is a very powerful method of retaining and understanding that knowledge more deeply. So we're careful to describe our enrolled applicants as "learners" or "players."

### Okay. You got me. Why do you also call us learners, "players?"
Cuz it's *that much* fun. There are few environments that allow you to learn as much as when you think you're playing a game. So we designed Learner's Guild to be a kind of playing field in which you, one of the players, must level up your coding skills to progress through the game.

### Will we be graded?
Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. There's a big difference. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you must be coerced to learn. Blech. We're not here to coerce. We only accept applicants who have a drive to learn. Learners don't focus on grades. Instead, they focus on improving their understanding and skills.

### What will we learn?
Over a period of about 10 months, you'll have the chance to learn everything you need to know to become a truly savvy web developer. You can find a list of **graduating skillsets, HERE.** 

### A $2,000/month Stipend? Really?
Yes. Really. We want you to focus on learning, not earning. A $2,000 monthly stipend allows you to make learning your full-time job for 10 months. Remember, if you don't succeed, then we don't. So we take our investment in you seriously.

### What does this cost? How does the money work? If you're investing in me, how do you get paid?
Good questions. First, the entire thing costs $42k. That includes $18,000 in stipends, and $24,000 in tuition. If you graduate and take a job earning more than $60k a year, then you pay us back the $42k out of whatever you make over your $60k yearly income. Typical starting salaries are $85k-$95k a year. So in most cases, you will be paid off within 1.5 to 2 years. All without any risk.

### What if I quit the process before graduating?
We are careful to choose applicants who a committed to the process, but if you leave early, you will only owe for the time you've participated. Suppose you stay for 10 weeks of the 40-week program, and collect 2 stipends. Then you'd owe 25% of the tuition ($6,000) along with $4,000 for the stipends.

### Are there lessons? Exercises?
Yes. But you have a measure of flexibility on what skills you want to level up on first. 

### Are there tests? Will we be graded?
Self-imposed tests, yes, as a way to improve your skills. Testing yourself is a great way of measuring your understanding and progress. It improves learning. Grading, however, doesn't. What't the point? Grades are like a carrot-and-stick view of learning, like you must be coerced to learn. Blech.


Why grade? What's the point? Of course. You will be testing yourself constantly to measure what you know. But grades? No. Nowhere in sight. Why do you need grades? The only feedback that counts is  
Our facilitators assist you to  you to learn how to learn. And our expert coders use their top-notch technical knowledge to build the environment and provide you with support and guidance

Teachers Facilitators, yes. We have top-coders with deep technical knowledge to help build the environment and give you powerful guidance and technical support. You won't be left blowing in the wind.
