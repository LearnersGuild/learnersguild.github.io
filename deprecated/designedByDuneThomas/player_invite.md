## Wanted: People who want to be coders.

### (Not just pale skinny dudes.)

TEST. Look, we don't care what color you are. If you're a man or woman, straight or gay. Hell, you could be a plaid, tri-sexual alien with... extra parts. It's not important. (Although that would be really cool.) The point is, if you want to learn to code, we want you.

No cash? No problem. Seriously. In fact, we’ll pay you a monthly stipend to learn. Say *what?!* That's right, you heard us. We're not a school. We're not a coding boot camp. We're investors looking for hungry minds. So then: Are you curious? Self-motivated? Do you like being challenged to grow and collaborate? Then *apply* to Learner's Guild.

Look, it's true. The student loan system is a scam. So we risk our success with the applicants we accept. If you graduate but don’t earn at least $60k salary, you pay us nothing. 

You walk in with a passion to learn. Give us 10 months to challenge you, guide you, and support you in the most fun and engaging learning environment you've ever been a part of. You walk out with a new career, new possibilities, and friends-for-life. From all walks of life. Truly. It's your best shot ever at joining a diverse, international league of superhero code ninjas.

*For God's sake! What are you waiting for?!* This is your *life* we're talking about. And Learner's Guild is your ticket. Are you ready to Level Up? Then **Apply Now.**
