<p>Look, we don’t care what color you are. If you’re a man or woman, straight or gay. Hell, you could be a plaid, tri-sexual alien with… extra parts. It’s not important. (Although that would be really cool.) The point is, if you want to learn to code, we want you.</p>

<p>No cash? No problem. Seriously. In fact, we’ll pay you a monthly stipend to learn. Say <em>what?!</em> That’s right, you heard us. We’re not a school. We’re not a coding boot camp. We’re investors looking for hungry minds. So then: Are you curious? Self-motivated? Do you like being challenged to grow and collaborate? Then <em>apply</em> to Learner’s Guild.</p>

<p>Look, it’s true. The student loan system is a scam. So we risk our success with the applicants we accept. If you graduate but don’t earn at least $60k salary, you pay us nothing.</p>

<p>You walk in with a passion to learn. Give us 10 months to challenge you, guide you, and support you in the most fun and engaging learning environment you’ve ever been a part of. You walk out with a new career, new possibilities, and friends-for-life. From all walks of life. Truly. It’s your best shot ever at joining a diverse, international league of superhero code ninjas.</p>

<p><em>For God’s sake! What are you waiting for?!</em> This is your <em>life</em> we’re talking about. And Learner’s Guild is your ticket. Are you ready to Level Up? Then <strong>Apply Now.</strong></p>
