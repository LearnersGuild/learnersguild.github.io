                <p class="text-faded">
                  Learners Guild is a learning incubator for soon-to-be software engineers.  Software engineers are in high demand, in fact there are thousands of unfilled jobs right now and the gap between open positions and qualified applicants is projected to keep growing. We help those with unrealized potential unlock their talents and transform their lives so they can compete in today’s economy and earn a dignified livelihood.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Risk-Free Tuition</h2>
                <hr class="light">

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    We have a simple proposition, if you don’t get a high-paying job, we don’t get paid. Period. If you give us your time, and bring your passion, we will invest in you by co-signing for your $28k tuition.  If you graduate and don’t earn at least a $60k salary, you pay us nothing.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Collective Learning: The Difference.</h2>
                  <hr class="light">

                    <p class="text-faded">
                      We have designed a supportive, collective environment, where you will learn the craft of software engineering through 10 months of collaborative apprenticeship. With the help of our expert learning facilitators you will learn not only how to code but more importantly how to problem solve and keep learning.  One thing we do know is that technologies will keep advancing so learning how to learn is one of the most valuable skill for software engineers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      We stagger our incoming classes so you get introduced to new skills from people like yourself who are just a few months ahead of you, and you get to master your technique by learning with those just a few months behind you.  By creating this type of collaborative environment we think you will not only build world class learning aptitude and skills but also new friends for life.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Investing in you.</h2>

                      <p class="text-faded">
                        There’s so much more to it than just learning engineering skills. Software development doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens with other people, which means knowing how to navigate social dynamics is just as important as knowing how to code. Developers who know how to skillfully navigate team dynamics and develop “emotional intelligence” are more likely to excel in the workplace.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-faded">
                        So Learners Guild addresses this head-on in our program with a combined technical and life skills learning.  We know this is going to be intense so we’ll even offer you a $2,000 a month living allowance while you attend. (We understand. It’s hard to focus on learning if you’re also struggling to cover the bills.)
                      </p>

                      <h4 class="section-heading">What.</h4>
                        <p class="text-faded">
                          Over 40 weeks, you’ll learn everything you need to know to do two things. One, make a dignified living as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack web developer. And two, launch your career.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">How.</h4>
                          <p class="text-faded">
                          Here’s where it gets exciting. We’re not a school. Schools are teaching environments. And we’re a learning environment. Tradition suggest knowledge is simply information that must be passed down from teachers to students. Yet we know that’s not true. In fact, it’s the opposite. Research shows that by exploring together, we all learn more, and we learn faster.
                          </p>
                          <p class="text-faded">
                            Learners Guild helps you build your abilities to tackle new challenges and gives you the chance to test your skills. You have the freedom to learn what you want, when you want, with a supportive group of peers who share similar goals. And our expert facilitators are there to help you choose your path of exploration, and to help you if you get stuck.
                          </p>
                          <p class="text-faded">
                            But there’s so much more to it than just learning engineering skills. Software development doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens in a social context, which means knowing how to navigate social dynamics is a plus. Developers who feel like strangers in a strange land, or don’t know how to skillfully navigate difficult team dynamics, will often leave their engineering career behind. This is particularly true for historically underrepresented groups of engineers. Why? Because a lack of emotional intelligence results in reduced learning and limits one’s ability to advance into leadership roles. So Learners Guild addresses this head-on in our program.
                          </p>
                          <p class="text-faded">
                            Computers follow logic. Humans don’t. Learners Guild provides tools to help you excel at working with both the world of machines and the world of people.
                          </p>

                    If you’re from an historically underrepresented group in the software community, we really want you in here. Black, Latino, Pacific Islander, LGBT, women, and persons with disabilities. We’ve designed our program to support you as well. And yes, White and Asian guys, we want you too. Truly. We want “the Great Plurality” of people. It’s actually quite simple: If you’re a driven learner seeking to build developer skills, we want you!

                    <em>No.</em> The top-down (teacher-student) approach embraced by most educational systems is out-dated, slow, and inefficient at best. Historically, bootcamps have a short-term vision aimed at helping students enter an industry.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Learners Guild, however, has a long-range vision that goes far beyond simply making the leap into software engineering. We want you to be set up for a rapidly advancing, extended career. Our program is designed around a cognitive apprenticeship method of learning-- one that has been vetted by scientists and learning researchers --that has shown itself to be a truly powerful means of both knowledge acquisition and skill development.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Because we use a “mutual exploration” (learners-only) model, and we believe in the effectiveness of this approach, we invest in our learners. It’s part of the collaborative spirit of exploring. If you don’t get paid well after graduating, you don’t owe us. We share the risk with you.

                    Yes. People who have attended schools for many years--- most of us ---assume that teaching is necessary for learning to occur. This is a fallacy. Learning and teaching are different, and we focus on learning. While we certainly have people with in-depth experience, senior level engineers, skilled facilitators, and so on, we don’t have teachers. A well designed learning environment causes a rapid transfer of knowledge from peers. As you learn, you will share what you know. This is a kind of “mutual exploration” of the knowledge. Trying to explain what you know challenges you to deepen your own understanding, even as you assist someone else with theirs.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Because technology changes so quickly, knowing information isn’t enough. It doesn’t take long for today’s right answers to become obsolete. To prepare you, our learning facilitators focus on improving your problem-solving skills. Essentially, you learn how to learn. This way, you’re equipped with the skills that make life-long learning attainable, something that’s critical to becoming a good developer.

                    Testing your understanding and skills? Definitely. But grades? No. There’s a big difference. Grading is a carrot-and-stick approach that assumes you must be coerced to learn. We’re not here to coerce. We only accept applicants who have a drive to learn. As learners, we don’t focus on grades. Instead, we focus on improving our understanding and skills. Essentially: We believe that ultimately, reality will be the assessor.

                    Good questions. The cost of attending Learners Guild is $28,000; however, there are no upfront costs. If a learner takes the maximum of the living allowance, that increases their cost of participation by an additional $20,000, bringing the total to $48,000. Once a learner has transitioned out into the workforce with earnings over $60,000, they will be obligated to initiate the repayment of their tuition and living allowance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Typical starting salaries are $85k-$95k a year. Learners have the option of paying back the loan in installments over a five year period, with an average payment of $500 a month for tuition and an additional $300 if the maximum amount of monthly living allowance are used. Learners Guild only makes money by receiving the cost of tuition. We put the stipend back in a pool for other learners to use.

                    It’s in our best interest to see you thrive. We’re very careful to choose applicants who are committed to the process, and if you’re committed to learning, we’re determined to give you all the support you need to finish. In fact, that’s one reason we allow you to take extra time if necessary. That all said, if you opt out, you will still owe the full tuition, and any stipends you’ve received. (On a case-by-case basis, we are willing to pause the program for those who face extenuating circumstances.)

                    Yes, you’ll have an excellent opportunity to work on projects that will add to your portfolio. Some projects will be smaller, while others will be larger.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    We’ve designed our learning environment to focus on team-work, so most of the projects are done in teams; however, there will be some opportunities to work on individual projects.

                    There are a few mandatory requirements to participate in the Learners Guild learning collective. They are an ability to participate full-time, a proficiency with the English language, a minimum age of 21 and previous employment history.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Beyond a common desire to become a premium software engineer in a mutually supportive environment ... perhaps first and foremost, all of our learners share a drive to learn and grow. Not just intellectually, but socially and emotionally as well. We expect a minimum level of personal development and maturity.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    We look for a baseline proficiency in both technical and social-emotional aptitude. It is important to understand that Learners Guild is not designed to support persons who are exploring software engineering for the first time. We are a learning collective that best works for advanced beginners.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    You should consider yourself fit for Learners Guild if you understand and can demonstrate the following:
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Algorithmic notions of control flow </li>
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Abstraction </li>
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Conditional thinking </li>
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Problem decomposition </li>
                      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Iterative thinking </li>
                    </ul>
                    If you are familiar with programming and have a crude understanding of it, then you would have used many of these concepts. If you have at least 50 to 100 hours of programming and web development experience under your belt, you will find Learners Guild an appropriate learning collective that will take your skills to another level.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Finally, we are excited about you if you have grit, if you are tenacious and understand that deliberate practice and sustained effort is what puts you on the path to success. We don’t care about your SAT scores, or whether or not you finished high-school, what we are interested in is your ability to learn and excitement about the craft of software engineering. If you can prove to us that you are ready to work hard in a learning collective, we would be happy to invest in you!

                    You’ll probably never stop asking this question. (We wish we existed when we started our careers.) In fact, it’s our goal that you ask this every day you show up and find yourself learning in ways you never thought possible. We want you to ask this 40 weeks later, when you’ve landed a job you didn’t think you could have.

                    <em>No.</em> We have specifically chosen not to provide job placement services. We made this decision because we want to ensure that <em>you</em> the learner remains our primary client. If we provided job placement services, we believe our attention would be divided between placing the business-the true client-interest over learners interest.

                    We have designed our learning experience around real-life industry ready skills. After six months at Learners Guild, you would have developed a good portfolio of work. Our hope is at that point, you start interviewing for your full-time position. For us, “gaining full-time employment as an engineer” is another skill that you will be developing at Learners Guild. Over your last few months in the program, you will get better and better at this, till the point where <em>you</em> will be the one decided where you will go and further grow your skills.

                    No. Our approach is strictly results oriented. There’s a lot of people with degrees, but no job to match it. It’s a common mistake to confuse a symbol for learning with the actual learning, itself. Learners Guild turns that around: if you don’t end up in a high-paying job, we don’t get paid. Our focus is on getting you ready for the workforce by helping you develop your skills which is demonstrated by your ability to create a portfolio of work.
