        <p class="lead">You’ve read this backstory before.</p>
        <p class="mb30">The products, services, and business models of higher education today aren’t serving their primary customer: students looking to develop resilient skills that will lead to fulfilling, financially-viable work. Costs continue to go up for education-as-a-service (not the outcomes), student debt rises along with it, and the juice doesn’t appear to be worth the squeeze — and risk — for the underemployed.</p>
        <blockquote class="mb30">
          This complex, systems-level problem — matching a valuable education to students through the use of a viable business model by institutions accountable for their success — is interwoven with the very fabric of our economy.
        </blockquote>
        <p>If students aren’t trained to take on the jobs of today and develop adaptable skills for the jobs of tomorrow, these graduates and our businesses — as well as civil society more broadly — will all suffer.</p>
        <p>There is no silver bullet to this ailing system. There will be many solutions, each taking on a unique and sizable market opportunity within. One that we’re proud to be backing, Learners Guild, is capitalizing on an immediate one: the unmet demand for over 1.4 million software development jobs in the next three years alone.</p>
        <h3 class="mb30">Reduced Risk for Learners, Increased Accountability for Institutions</h3>
        <p>Learners Guild combines a technical education with an income-based repayment model that opens the doors to everyone, especially those who don’t have the financial ability to attend university or bootcamp. The organization targets, screens, and accepts the most motivated applicants to join cohorts led by coding experts and group facilitators in their local communities.</p>
        <p>Five-person groups start weekly, providing learners the opportunity to be supported by more advanced peers while later mentoring newer learners themselves over the course of the 40-week program.</p>
        <p>Learners have the option of no tuition up front plus a $1,500/month living stipend, paying back a percentage of their salary for a limited time — only if they get a job, and only if that job pays them at least $50K. In other words, Learners Guild wins if, and only if, their graduates get a job.</p>
        <p>The team, led by Shereef Bishay, is on the front end of a more seamless, outcome-based, leaner-centered movement in education that we hope to see more of. We’re proud to be investing alongside Mitch &amp; Freada Kapor, Learn Capital, and a number of others.</p>
        <p>We’re not suggesting here that every post-secondary program should be trade-oriented (they shouldn’t!) or that liberal arts don’t matter (it does!). We need artists, philosophers, and anthropologists — especially in business.</p>
        <p class="mb30">But we also need software developers. A million more of them, to be precise. And to do so, we must reduce friction and risk in helping people reinvent themselves to take full advantage of these opportunities.</p>
